<h3>Lesson3: Architecture</h3>
<h4>Authentication :
  <br> Client Loging page send a request and receive an authentication Token
  <br>from server end point : JWT (Jason Web Token)
  <br> local storage for token keys
</h4>

<h4> Between web sesion the JWT will confirm to server the authorized routes for pages to be open</h4>

<h3>Lesson3: Jason Web Tokens</h3>
<h4>The token that server is sending to client after succeful authentiction
  <br> it has 3 parts:
  <br> Header -  red
  <br> a payload that is indicated by purple
  <br> a digital signature indicated by blue</h4>
  <img src="assets/Images/C11L4Auth1.PNG" width=500px>
<h4>
  <br> the content is encoded using base 64 algorithm, in could be decoded
</h4>

<h3>Lesson5: Implementing Login</h3>
<h4> implementing loginn method, with a console log to see the response</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L5Auth1.PNG" width=400px>
<h4> in case of correct credentials will receve the token</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L5Auth2.PNG" width=600px>
<h4> Implement the condition of the result exists anf token is received
  <br> that is stored in LocalStorage and return true
</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L5Auth3.PNG" width=400px>
<h4> Stored received token could be checked in console>application
 
</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L5Auth4.PNG" width=600px>
<h4> the response from login() is receive in signIn() as credentials
<br> and is checked is is true or false in programatic routing
 <br> or inlalidLoging for show error message div
</h4>

<hr>
<h3>Lesson6: implementing Logout</h3>
<h4>inject the authservice in the home component </h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L6Auth3.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>and bind it with click event in the template</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L6Auth2.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>in the method will delete the token from localStorage</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L6Auth1.PNG" width=400px>

<hr>
<h3>Lesson7: Showing or Hiding elements</h3>
<h4>if we have stored a tolken and is nor expired that means that user is loggedin 
  <br> and isLogged in will return true otherway will return false 
<br> instal : npm install angular2-jwt --save</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L7Auth1.PNG" width=400px>
<h4> we will apply isLoggedIn() in the Home template with *ngIf directive</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L7Auth2.PNG" width=400px>
<h4> when logout admin is not swon and in the console we cane select
</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L7Auth3.1.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>
   expiration date nul and is exipred false</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L7Auth3.2.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>
  refactoring with the global function:
<br> tokenNotExpired()</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L7Auth4.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>in he templete with *ngIf is shown or not the content</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L7Auth5.PNG" width=400px>

<h3>Lesson8: Showing or Hiding Elements based on User Roll</h3>
<h4> create a new method surrentUser() for
  reading the  token content</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L8Auth1.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>
  adding additional condition for user roll based on currentUser return</h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L8Auth1.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>
  generate a token with admin =  false </h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L8Auth3.PNG" width=600px>

<h4>
  and replace the token in the fakeBackEnd </h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L8Auth4.PNG" width=400px>
<h4>
  after connect we will not see the admin options </h4>
<img src="assets/Images/C11L8Auth5.PNG" width=400px>

<h3>Lesson9: Getting the current user</h3>
<h4> the user will be shown only if is logged in</h4>
